# Churn_Rate_project

Machine Learning project for my Master's Degree in Data Science.

We are a school travel agency, and over the past year we have noticed a decline in sales, especially from regular customers.
The goal is to build a model that predict whether a school trip ('ID_SALES') will be retained the next year (target variable: 'Retained', 0 or 1). 
The dataset is divided in CRM, Finance, Sales, merged in 'df_merged' (see first notebook). The problem is addressed in a way that minimises FPs (better Precision).

The second notebook includes Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering. The third notebook includes the models training. The last notebook includes feature analysis through Shapley Values.
